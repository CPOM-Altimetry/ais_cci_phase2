<h3>Cumulative Annual dH</h3>
<p>These products provide the cumulative surface height 
    change in each 5km grid cell since the start of the 
    radar altimetry record, derived from cross-calibrated 
multi-mission radar altimetry measurements from ERS-1, ERS-2, ENVISAT,
CryoSat-2, Sentinel-3A, and Sentinel-3B. Products are stepped by 
one year to provide the change of height up until the end of that year.</p>
